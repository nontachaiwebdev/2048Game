This is our first Beautiful JavaScript challenge, where your elegant code can win you awesome prizes! For full details and rules, check out the official announcement here.

CFBot stores all of her important information in the Secret Archives. CodeMaster is trying to pick the lock! The lock, a metal rectangle composed of movable cells, is unique and hard to pick. Some of the lock’s cells are occupied, and some are empty. The lock is unlocked when its occupied cells form a specific configuration.

CodeMaster’s plan is to apply magnets to the lock’s 4 sides (one side at a time) to get the cells aligned correctly. CodeMaster doesn’t have much time to try to pick the lock before CFBot finds him, and he doesn’t want to waste time trying out different sequences. So you’re going to help him by implementing a function that, given a sequence of operations, will output the final state of the lock.
